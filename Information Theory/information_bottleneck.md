### Information Bottleneck Theory

* ü•á 2000: [The Information Bottleneck Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057) <br>
This paper proposed the information bottleneck method to study the concept of relevant information quantitatively. It studies the trade-off between compression and prediction to find the concise representations for an input random variable that contain as much relevant information as possible for an output variable.

* ü•â 2001: [Multivariate Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2270) <br>
This paper extended the orignal information bottleneck method to multivariate cases.
